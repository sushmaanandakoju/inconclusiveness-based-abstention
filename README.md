# inconclusiveness-based-abstention

This project was started in January 2025 and has undergone multiple changes since.

**The files included here are not part of the most recent submission, which is completely different from earlier versions.**

**The recent submission (Fall 2025) to a workshop/program is completely distinct from previous versions/reports/submissions and acknowledges a prior review received.** Although the notebooks here used neurosymbolic methods (and I am no longer working on neurosymbolic AI), the recent submission uses a different methodology inspired by newer versions of Large Language Models (LLMs).

The recent submission details are not currently included here. **Due to limited computational resources, I am placing this project on hold and looking for new/recent/long‑term collaborators. I am seeking collaborators who value quality and sufficient time for ideas to develop naturally through experiments and discussions, even if progress is slow, rather than prioritizing quantity or rushed work, and who are outside my prior Arizona connections due to divergence of research goals.**

**For those interested to collaborate on this work, please create an issue from the Issues tab with a "question"/"help-wanted" tag and I'd be glad to connect.** This will also help me make the recent submission public on DeSci Labs and share the latest changes to this project for open‑science initiatives. Thank you.
